# paint-code-fake
Implement a Mac application which like the Paint Code.
Since I'm studying The Core Graphics Framework based on iOS/OSX, make it as a practice to finish this opensource application.
Because it(The Paint Code App) is a really good app, and I'm wondering how does it works, so I begin this.
And, this is my first project on GitHub. Hope it can improve myself.
